Best Practices for MLOps
🗂 1. Project Structure
Organize with a clear, modular directory layout (code, data, docs).

Use Git for version control and team collaboration.

🧰 2. Tool Selection
Choose ML frameworks that fit your use case and team skills.

Leverage cloud platforms for scalability and accessibility.

🔁 3. CI/CD (Continuous Integration & Delivery)
Automate model testing, validation, and deployment using CI/CD pipelines.

Ensure that every code change triggers automated model checks.

📊 4. Monitoring & Testing
Continuously track model performance in production.

Detect issues like data drift, concept drift, or performance degradation.

Test data quality, model accuracy, and business metrics.

⚙️ 5. Automation of Data Flow
Automate data ingestion, preprocessing, and feature engineering.

Use tools for data versioning and lineage tracking.

📝 6. Documentation
Document all stages of the ML lifecycle: experiments, decisions, deployment.

Ensure reproducibility and team transparency.

🔧 Key Components of an MLOps System
🔄 Model Training Pipeline
Automate training and validation using fresh data on a schedule or trigger.

📦 Model Registry
Track versions of models, their metadata, and deployment history.

Enable model comparison, promotion, and rollback.

🧠 Feature Store
Standardize and centralize feature definitions.

Ensure consistency between training and serving environments.

🔁 Feedback Loop
Capture real-world usage data and user feedback.

Use it to retrain or fine-tune models for continuous improvement.
